
The implementation of HoE is located in the 'Code/HoE' directory. 
To comply with the double-blind review policy, all file paths, code comments, and potentially identifying information have been removed.

Due to size constraints of the supplementary materials, the complete set of models—including Single-Objective Experts, Multi-Objective Experts, and Router Experts—has been made available via an anonymous GitHub repository: (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/anonymous-repo-for-NIPS-4263/README.md).

While the current submission contains all key components required for reproduction, the full version of the code and models will be further released through the same anonymous repository for completeness.
